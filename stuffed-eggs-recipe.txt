Russian Stuffed Eggs

1 doz. large (jumbo) eggs
1/2 lbs large mushrooms
1 bunch parsly
ground black pepper
Mayonnaise (I used Cholestrol Free Kraft)

Boil the eggs for 10 minutes or more (until they're hard)
let them cool off completely.

Chop the mushrooms very finely (a good food processor will help) 
The goal is to have about 2 cups of chopped mushrooms for every
dozen eggs.

Chop 1/2 cup of parsly (very very fine, food processor type fine)

Cut the eggs in half and take out the yolks. Mix the egg yolks with 
the mushrooms, parsly and add a tea spoon full of black pepper. 

Add 1/2 cup mayonnaise and stir the whole thing. You should have a 
grey, mushroomy paste. 

Stuff each hollow egg half with heaping teaspoon of the paste. Put
a tiny little bit of mayo on top and stick a parsly leaf on.
Refrigerate before serving. 

Most people grabbed 3 - 4 halves, so plan accordingly. 
If you're handy around the kitchen, 3 dozens of this should not
take you more than 1 hour and you can prepare this hours ahead.
